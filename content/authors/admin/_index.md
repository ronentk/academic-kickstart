I'm a PhD student in the [Hyadata Data Science Lab](http://www.hyadatalab.com/) in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, under the supervision of Dafna Shahaf.

Exploring the borderlands of human and artificial intelligence research, and how we can better bridge between them.

In particular, I'm currently interested in grounded cognition research and how it may help in building deeper language understanding and higher level cognition into AI systems.

My B.Sc and M.Sc were also at Hebrew University, in computer engineering and computer science, respectively. My M.Sc thesis was on applications of hierarchical tensor decompostions towards principled neural network design, under the supervision of Amnon Shashua.
