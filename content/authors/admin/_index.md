I‚Äôm a researcher and entrepreneur working on distributed collective intelligence systems to help us think better, together. I‚Äôm currently an [Entrepreneur-in-Residence](https://astera.org/upgrading-scientific-dialogue/) in the [Astera Institute](https://astera.org/). We‚Äôre developing [Sensemaking Networks](https://paragraph.xyz/@sense-nets/sense-nets-intro), a new kind of social network combining AI and [semantic nanopublishing](https://nanopub.net/), to improve how we collectively curate, evaluate, disseminate and discuss scientific research.

I finished my PhD at the¬†[Hyadata Data Science Lab](http://www.hyadatalab.com/)¬†in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where my research focused on cognitive-inspired computational models of natural language understanding. I‚Äôm particularly interested in [embodied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition) and [stigmergic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389041707000290) cognition, and the role of learning environments in shaping human and machine intelligence.

I‚Äôm passionate about sociotechnical activism and building for impactful pro-social change! I‚Äôm a co-founder of¬†[Common SenseMakers](https://www.csensemakers.com/), a community focused on research and development around distributed collective sensemaking. We‚Äôre working on technology and practices to help people and groups navigate information overload, find meaning and connection, and make sense of an increasingly complex world.

I'm also into various other embodied pursuits like trekking, cycling, yoga and world music.
