abstract: "Sensemaking Networks is a project aiming to address three interrelated limitations of the current science publishing and communication infrastructure: (1) poor reach and feedback, (2) knowledge fragmentation, and (3) rigid formats. To address these issues, Sensemaking Networks combine two promising trends in science publishing and communication: science social media and semantic nanopublishing. While science social media significantly impacts scientific processes and public engagement, it lacks formal recognition and accessibility. On the other hand, nanopublications offer the benefits of formal scientific publishing and machine-readable knowledge representation. Their integration represents a promising direction that could serve as a transformative sensemaking layer for science, enhancing the collective synthesis, dissemination, and evaluation of research."
