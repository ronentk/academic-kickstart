title: "DeSci Denver 2024: DeSci Sensemaking Networks"
event: DeSci Denver 2024


summary: ""
abstract: "Semantic publishing has long been a holy grail in the quest for more open, democratic and navigable science communication. However, the “semantic web of science” dream has also been notoriously elusive. Fortunately, advances in AI and decentralization, coupled with disillusionment from the current extractive scientific system, are converging to make this vision an exciting and imminent possibility. This talk will present the Sensemaking Networks project, a new kind of social network combining AI and semantic nanopublishing, to improve how we collectively curate, evaluate, disseminate and discuss scientific research."
